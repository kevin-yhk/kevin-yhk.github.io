Not going to lie, I had envisioned out a project idea and was confident that I'd easily get through with it. I was in for a rude awakening.  I had to go back to previous lessons and relearn and review everything and even after completing this project, I will go back and review because there's just so much to learn and retain.  

The premise of this project is pretty simple.  As for those who've watch Rick & Morty, we know that there are an infinite versions of every character.  This project pulls an API which is populated with every character in existence within the show.  For the sake of this project, I decided to only utilize Rick's because he is essentially my favorite character.  Basically, the CLI will allow to user to list all the Rick's by their own unique name, and the user will be able to find out more about a particular Rick by entering the full name.  First off, I created a list names method where it will iterate over the array of Rick's and it will map out only the Rick's names in a new array, thus giving users the ability to see which Rick's are available to perform further actions on.  Secondly, I created a find by names method where it'll first find if the user input of a name does exist within the array, then it'll execute the rest of the method by printing out the respective Rick's description and information. After the user had their fill of finding out information about all the different Rick's, the user can simply enter "exit" as an input and the program will end with a message saying "Goodbye moonman!". 

I particularly enjoyed this project, and was interested to find out there were certain characters that I didn't even know about or might've glanced over when I watched the show.  As excited I am to rewatch the entire series, that'll have to wait for another time.  The challenges that were set within the Ruby curriculum and this project showed me that I still have a lot of room for improvement, and I am looking forward to those upcoming challenges.  As Rick would say, "wubba lubba dub dub"!  Let's keep on learning.
