I’ve always had an affinity for building things and I turned that into my passion.  It all started for me when I was gifted my first LEGO set which was the star wars X-wing back in 1999. It then progressed to Gundam models, making statistical models during my stint as an analyst, performing DIY maintenance and modifications on my car, then onto tweaking around my car’s computer. My affinity for building showed me a path towards coding and made me realize that there is a plethora of things I can build. I've heard various stories from others that graudated similar coding bootcamps, in the industry, etc. and that learning to code is going to be a very challenging experience and one must be very devoted to learning and finding a sense of happiness of solving errors. They weren't lying at all, and it has been quite a bit challenging on my journey so far in this bootcamp. Besides learning to code, I think this journey will also teach me to be resilient and steadfast and build strong habits to not only be successful in this bootcamp but in other aspects of life as well.  I’d love to learn more and all there is to become a software engineer to not only help build products and services that are cool and exciting but are also practical and beneficial.
