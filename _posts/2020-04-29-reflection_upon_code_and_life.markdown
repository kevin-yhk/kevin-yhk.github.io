Being a part of this bootcamp, I've begun to see some connections between how I treat every day life and the life of being a  full-time student.  Self preseverance, patience, the necessity to kill procrastination amongst many other things were being applied during this time and really testing my previous way of life and making me look at things at a different perspective.  I think that this bootcamp and the art of learning code has not only given me the ability to learn code, but has also given me an aspect on how I can shape my past way of living and really incorporate these habits into every day practices. 

The learning practices at Flatiron can be translated into something like learning to take of yourself. Learning an entirely new language like Ruby is like that of learning that you can apply yourself in a way to improve. The amount of times that I didn't get code working and feeling stressed and lost is very comparable to the same way that I felt like I was lost myself in life and what I needed to work on to better myself. The learning process never stops and in with both respects to code and life, I believe that I can use these two hand in hand to truly get a better perspective of my future.
